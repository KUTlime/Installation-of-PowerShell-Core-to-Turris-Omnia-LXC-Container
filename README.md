# Installation of PowerShell to Turris Omnia LXC Container

> This repo is a step-by-step tutorial how to install PowerShell to Turris Omnia LXC container. It's aiming to Windows/PowerShell oriented users which not familiar with SSH/Bash environment and the official tutorials from CZ.NIC are driving them crazy.

## Overview

The installation consists of these steps:

1. Create Debian LXC container
2. Install prerequisites
3. Deployment of PowerShell libraries to LXC container
4. Hello world!

## 1. Create Debian LXC container

Connect to your Turris Omnia router by SSH and create the LXC container for PowerShell. **[Official Manual](https://www.turris.cz/doc/en/howto/lxc)**

**Note**: If you don't see any templates in LuCI or you receive [this](https://forum.turris.cz/t/lxc-container-no-templates/5296/17) error, just change your DNS settings in Foris from whatever you have there to Cloudface or anything else. The problem is caused by DNS which is not resolving template URL correctly.

```bash
lxc-create -t download -n PowerShell
```

- Distribution: **Debian**
- Release: **Bullseye**
- Architecture: **armv7l** (that is seven and the lower "L" letter, not 1 (digit)

Alternatively, you can use LuCI to create the LXC container. A distribution doesn't not really matter. This tutorial was tested on Debian but it would work more likely on other distributions.

## 2. Simple Debian configuration

Start the container from LuCI or by executing this command:

```bash
lxc-start -n PowerShell
```

Connect to the container:

```bash
lxc-attach -n PowerShell
```

Install prerequisites:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install git-core openssh-server rsync sudo fakeroot cifs-utils nano wget libunwind8 icu-devtools jq -y
```

SSH is not really necessary but it may become handy sooner or later.

Change the container hostname (for eg. `PowerShell`):

```bash
nano /etc/hostname
```

Set the new hostname to localhost:

```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```

Add this line (for `PowerShell` as hostname):

```bash
127.0.1.1   PowerShell
```

Reboot the LXC container from LuCI interface or execute this command:

```bash
exit
```

to exit the LXC container SSH session (*which takes you to your Turris Omnia session*) and

```bash
lxc-stop -n PowerShell -r
```

to restart the container.

Go to **Foris**, the **DNS** setting tab and turn on the "Domain of DHCP clients in DNS" if you don't have it enabled already. Now, you can access the LXC container by its domain name - **PowerShell**.

After restart, you can connect to the container by executing:

```bash
lxc-attach -n PowerShell
```

and if your setup was successful, you should see: **root@PowerShell:~#** in your terminal.

## 3. Deployment of PowerShell libraries to LXC container

Now, let's create a directory for PowerShell and set path to it.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/powershell/7 && cd $HOME/powershell
```

Now, you can download the PowerShell binaries:

```bash
wget -qO- $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep "linux-arm32.tar.gz") | tar zxf - -C $HOME/powershell/7
```

You can customize this link to whatever version of PowerShell you want. Don't forget to change a specific path (*name of last directory, 7 in our case*) in previous and following command for each specific version of PowerShell you wish to run:

```bash
tar zxf ./powershell-7.2.0-linux-arm32.tar.gz -C $HOME/powershell/7
```

For an easy use of PowerShell, you can execute:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

and enter these lines at the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/powershell/7
```

This will create powershell environmental variables every time when you log in to the container by SSH. **If you have plans to run multiple PowerShell version side-by-side, I would avoid the manipulation with the environment variables and just use a full path classification.**

Now, you can execute:

```bash
exit
```

to exit the LXC container SSH session (*which takes you to your Turris Omnia session*) and

```bash
lxc-stop -n PowerShell -r
```

to restart the container. After restart, execute:

```bash
lxc-attach -n PowerShell
```

to attach to the container again. Now, you should have all set and good to go.

## 4. Hello world

Try to run following command:

```bash
pwsh
```

if you see following outcome (*it may change overtime*)

```bash
PowerShell 7.1.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.
```

go ahead and try the **Hello world** cmdlet to write to the console.

```bash
Write-Host "Hello World!"
```

If you see:

```bash
Hello World!
```

congratulation! You have fully operational PowerShell up and running in the LXC container hosted in your Turris Omnia.

If you receive the error "bash: pwsh: command not found" navigate manually to it:

```bash
cd $HOME/powershell/7/
```

and execute the `pwsh` command here. Alternatively, you can use the full path classification:

```bash
$HOME/powershell/7/pwsh
```

## Auto update of PowerShell via cron

Create a shell script with following commands:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/sbin"
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get autoclean
echo "Updating PowerShell"
wget -qO- $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep "linux-arm32.tar.gz") | tar zxf - -C $HOME/powershell/7
chmod +x /root/powershell/7/pwsh
```

Place it to some location, e.g., `/root/installUpdate.sh`.

In terminal, execute these commands:

```bash
apt-get install cron jq curl -y
chmod +x /root/installUpdate.sh
crontab -e
```

Insert a following line of code:

```bash
44 4 * * * /root/installUpdate.sh >> /var/log/updatejob.log 2>&1
```

This will execute the script every single day at 04:44.

## Accelerated version for power user

Create a container

```bash
lxc-create -t download -n PowerShell
lxc-start -n PowerShell
lxc-attach -n PowerShell
```

Install PowerShell and configure the container environment

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install git-core openssh-server rsync sudo fakeroot cifs-utils nano wget curl cron libunwind8 icu-devtools jq -y
nano /etc/hostname
nano /etc/hosts
mkdir -p $HOME/powershell/7 && cd $HOME/powershell
wget -qO- $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep "linux-arm32.tar.gz") | tar zxf - -C $HOME/powershell/7
chmod +x /root/powershell/7/pwsh
nano ~/.bashrc
exit
```

Restart and reconnect

```bash
lxc-stop -n PowerShell -r
lxc-attach -n PowerShell
```

Prepare automatic update

```bash
chmod +x /root/installUpdate.sh
nano /root/installUpdate.sh
```

Copy/paste the update script logic

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/sbin"
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get autoclean
echo "Updating PowerShell"
wget -qO- $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep "linux-arm32.tar.gz") | tar zxf - -C $HOME/powershell/7
chmod +x /root/powershell/7/pwsh
```

Prepare update

```bash
crontab -e
```

Insert a following line of code:

```bash
44 4 * * * /root/installUpdate.sh >> /var/log/updatejob.log 2>&1
```
